title: Routed setup (No NAT)
---

This guide shows how to run **wg-easy** with a routed setup so packets are forwarded instead of NATed.

In a routed design, each WireGuard client keeps its own IPv4/IPv6 address. That means you can identify clients by their real addresses instead of seeing everything as the WireGuard server’s IP.

## Requirements

1. You know how to add static routes on your router to the WireGuard server.

## Docker setup

To make use of our own IPv4/IPv6 addresses, run the container with the `network_mode: host` option.

```yaml
services:
  wg-easy:
    image: ghcr.io/wg-easy/wg-easy:15
    container_name: wg-easy
    network_mode: "host"
    volumes:
      - ./config:/etc/wireguard
      - /lib/modules:/lib/modules:ro
    cap_add:
      - NET_ADMIN
      - SYS_MODULE
    devices:
      - /dev/net/tun:/dev/net/tun
    restart: unless-stopped
```

Because we’re on the host network, remove any `ports:` and container `sysctls:` you might have had before.

## Kernel parameters (on the host)

With host networking, system sysctls must be set on the **host**. On your host, create `/etc/sysctl.d/90-wireguard.conf`:

```
net.ipv4.ip_forward=1
net.ipv4.conf.all.src_valid_mark=1
net.ipv6.conf.all.disable_ipv6=0
net.ipv6.conf.all.forwarding=1
net.ipv6.conf.default.forwarding=1
```

Apply and verify:
```bash
sysctl -p /etc/sysctl.d/90-wireguard.conf
sysctl -n net.ipv4.ip_forward   # should print 1
```

## Add static routes on your router

Pick an IPv4 and IPv6 subnet for your clients and add static routes on your router, pointing to the wireguard server's LAN addresses.

### Example

/// note | 2001:db8::/32

The *documentation prefix* `2001:db8::/32` (RFC 3849) used in this example is not meant for production use, replace it with your own ISP-assigned IPv6 prefix (GUA) or local prefix (LUA)
///


I want my WireGuard clients in `192.168.0.0/24` and `2001:db8:abc:0::/64`.

- Routed IPv4 subnet: `192.168.0.0/24`
- Routed IPv6 prefix: `2001:db8:abc:0::/64`
- WireGuard server IPs: `192.168.10.118` and `2001:db8:abc:10:216:3eff:fedb:949e`

On your router:
- Route `192.168.0.0/24` → next hop `192.168.10.118`
- Route `2001:db8:abc:0::/64` → next hop `2001:db8:abc:10:216:3eff:fedb:949e`

Don't forget to create the neccesary firewall rules to allow these subnets to travel across your LAN. Some routers like OPNSense/PFSense may require specific Outbound NAT rules for the chosen IPv4 subnet.

## Wireguard Easy configuration

In the web UI → Admin → Interface, click Change CIDR and set the IPv4/IPv6 routed subnets you chose above. Save.

Then go to Admin → Hooks and add:

PostUp
```
iptables -A INPUT -p udp -m udp --dport {{port}} -j ACCEPT; iptables -A FORWARD -i wg0 -j ACCEPT; iptables -A FORWARD -o wg0 -j ACCEPT; ip6tables -A INPUT -p udp -m udp --dport {{port}} -j ACCEPT; ip6tables -A FORWARD -i wg0 -j ACCEPT; ip6tables -A FORWARD -o wg0 -j ACCEPT
```

PostDown
```
iptables -D INPUT -p udp -m udp --dport {{port}} -j ACCEPT; iptables -D FORWARD -i wg0 -j ACCEPT; iptables -D FORWARD -o wg0 -j ACCEPT; ip6tables -D INPUT -p udp -m udp --dport {{port}} -j ACCEPT; ip6tables -D FORWARD -i wg0 -j ACCEPT; ip6tables -D FORWARD -o wg0 -j ACCEPT
