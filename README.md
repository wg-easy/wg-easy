## Versions

> üí° We follow semantic versioning (semver)

We offer multiple Docker image tags to suit your needs. The table below is in a particular order, with the first tag being the most recommended:

| tag           | Branch                                                     | Example                                                       | Description                                                                                                                          |

## Installation

### 1. Install Docker

If you haven't installed Docker yet, install it by running as root:

```shell
curl -sSL https://get.docker.com | sh
exit
```

And log in again.

### 2. Run WireGuard Easy

The easiest way to run WireGuard Easy is with Docker Compose.

Just download [`docker-compose.yml`](docker-compose.yml), make necessary adjustments and
execute `sudo docker compose up -d`.

Now setup a reverse proxy to be able to access the Web UI from the internet.

If you want to access the Web UI over HTTP, change the env var `INSECURE` to `true`. This is not recommended. Only use this for testing
