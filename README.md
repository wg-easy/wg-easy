## Versions

> üí° We follow semantic versioning (semver)

We offer multiple Docker image tags to suit your needs. The table below is in a particular order, with the first tag being the most recommended:

| tag           | Branch                                                             | Example                                                       | Description                                                                                                                                |

## Installation

### 1. Install Docker

If you haven't installed Docker yet, install it by running:

```shell
curl -sSL https://get.docker.com | sh
sudo usermod -aG docker $(whoami)
exit
```

And log in again.

### 2. Run WireGuard Easy

<!-- TODO: prioritize docker compose over docker run -->

To setup the IPv6 Network, simply run once:

```bash
  docker network create \
  -d bridge --ipv6 \
  -d default \
  --subnet 10.42.42.0/24 \
  --subnet fdcc:ad94:bacf:61a3::/64 wg \
```

To automatically install & run wg-easy, simply run:

```bash
  docker run -d \
  --net wg \
  -e PORT=51821 \
  --name wg-easy \
  --ip6 fdcc:ad94:bacf:61a3::2a \
  --ip 10.42.42.42 \
  -v ~/.wg-easy:/etc/wireguard \
  -v /lib/modules:/lib/modules:ro \
  -p 51820:51820/udp \
  -p 51821:51821/tcp \
  --cap-add NET_ADMIN \
  --cap-add SYS_MODULE \
  --sysctl net.ipv4.ip_forward=1 \
  --sysctl net.ipv4.conf.all.src_valid_mark=1 \
  --sysctl net.ipv6.conf.all.disable_ipv6=0 \
  --sysctl net.ipv6.conf.all.forwarding=1 \
  --sysctl net.ipv6.conf.default.forwarding=1 \
  --restart unless-stopped \
  ghcr.io/wg-easy/wg-easy
```

The Web UI will now be available on `http://0.0.0.0:51821`.

The Prometheus metrics will now be available on `http://0.0.0.0:51821/api/metrics`. Grafana dashboard [21733](https://grafana.com/grafana/dashboards/21733-wireguard/)

> üí° Your configuration files will be saved in `~/.wg-easy`

WireGuard Easy can be launched with Docker Compose as well - just download
[`docker-compose.yml`](docker-compose.yml), make necessary adjustments and
execute `docker compose up -d`.

## Options

These options can be configured by setting environment variables using `-e KEY="VALUE"` in the `docker run` command.

| Env       | Default           | Example       | Description                                  |
| --------- | ----------------- | ------------- | -------------------------------------------- |
| `PORT`    | `51821`           | `6789`        | TCP port for Web UI.                         |
| `HOST`    | `0.0.0.0`         | `localhost`   | IP address web UI binds to.                  |

## Updating

To update to the latest version, simply run:

```shell
docker stop wg-easy
docker rm wg-easy
docker pull ghcr.io/wg-easy/wg-easy
```

And then run the `docker run -d \ ...` command above again.

With Docker Compose WireGuard Easy can be updated with a single command:
`docker compose up --detach --pull always` (if an image tag is specified in the
Compose file and it is not `latest`, make sure that it is changed to the desired
one; by default it is omitted and
[defaults to `latest`](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/run/#image-references)). \
The WireGuard Easy container will be automatically recreated if a newer image
was pulled.
